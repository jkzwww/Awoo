FIT2097 assignment 1 survival game prototype

Name: Zhi Wei Loh   ID: 31123074

How to play: 
- collect pickups to maintain player status ( health, hydration, hunger)
- find keys and other items for use (unlock, light torches)
- flip switches and unlock switches that activates pit trap bridges to cross safely
- escape the room safely by activating all the platforms that lead to exit

What works:
- All player , gameplay and item requirements in brief are reached.
- HUDS including start , pause , inventory ,in-game and end screens.

What doesnt work:
- For extra feature of dropping item, the item does drop from inventory 
but setting actor hidden in game to false is not working.

Extra features and unsure points :
- Inventory HUD that allows player to see all items and consume pickups instantly.
- The idea of my survival game is similar to an escape by an animal (wolf) from a place to another.
- Therefore, features such as shooting are not used, further skills and features are to be developed after this prototype.
- Due to the brief, map is somewhat limited to more like a platformer.
- Not sure whether self created material is allowed,however it is just some simple emmissive material as 
game environment is design to be dark and all given materials are hard to see in game.
